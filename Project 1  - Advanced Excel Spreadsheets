Overview:
I conducted advanced spreadsheet analysis on Airbnb data to identify the most attractive neighborhoods and property sizes for vacation rentals. Using data cleaning techniques 
and Excel functions such as SUMIF, IF, and PivotTables, I analyzed rental trends based on the number of reviews and various property characteristics. This enabled me to calculate
revenue projections and determine the top-earning listings. To communicate these insights effectively, I developed visual reports including bar charts and interactive dashboards, 
highlighting patterns in rental demand and revenue potential.
